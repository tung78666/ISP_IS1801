Hello! I'm a writer of television, features, podcast and COMICS! I'm the creator and co-writer of the 2x Eisner nominated graphic novel "Bubble." My next graphic novel with artist Bowen McCurdy is out 7/16/24! It's a YA horror-comedy about teenage exorcists and I'm SO EXCITED for folks to see it. Please give it a "want to read" on here and a pre-order wherever you get your books!

You might also know me as the actor behind many unpleasant characters on "Good Mythical Morning" or the co-host of the not-super-popular but long-running podcast "Jordan Jesse Go!"

Based on the smash-hit audio serial, Bubble is a hilarious high-energy graphic novel with a satirical take on the “gig economy.”

Built and maintained by corporate benevolence, the city of Fairhaven is a literal bubble of safety and order (and amazing coffee) in the midst of the Brush, a harsh alien wilderness ruled by monstrous Imps and rogue bands of humans. Humans like Morgan, who’s Brush-born and Bubble-raised and fully capable of fending off an Imp attack during her morning jog. She’s got a great routine going—she has a chill day job, she recreationally kills the occasional Imp, then she takes that Imp home for her roommate and BFF, Annie, to transform into drugs as a side hustle. But cracks appear in her tidy life when one of those Imps nearly murders a delivery guy in her apartment, accidentally transforming him into a Brush-powered mutant in the process. And when Morgan’s company launches Huntr, a gig economy app for Imp extermination, she finds herself press-ganged into kicking her stabby side job up to the next level as she battles a parade of monsters and monstrously Brush-turned citizens, from a living hipster beard to a book club hive mind.
